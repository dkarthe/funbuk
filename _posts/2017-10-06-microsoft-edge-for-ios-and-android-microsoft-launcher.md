It’s amazing what’s possible today—but don’t you wish your phone could magically send that task to your <strong>Windows 10</strong> PC where you could luxuriate in a big screen and hardware keyboard?
<p class="">With the new preview apps we’re launching for iOS and Android – you can. Introducing <strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> for iOS/Android and <strong>Microsoft Launcher</strong> for Android, two apps designed to make it easy to move what you’re working on between your phone and PC.</p>
We are excited to continue the work we announced at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener">Build</a> to make Windows 10 PCs work great with your phone. Microsoft Edge for iOS is available starting today in preview, with Microsoft Edge for Android available soon in preview. And, Microsoft Launcher is available starting today in preview as well. Continue on PC functionality in both apps comes with the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows 10 Fall Creators Update</a>.
<h1 class="">Microsoft Edge for iOS and Android</h1>
One of the most common requests we hear from people who use Microsoft Edge on Windows 10 PCs is “we want our browser experience to move to our phones”. You spoke, we listened.

Microsoft Edge for iOS and Android brings familiar features like your Favorites, Reading List, New Tab Page and Reading View across your PC and phone, so, no matter the device, your browsing goes with you. But what makes Microsoft Edge really stand out is the ability to continue on your PC, which enables you to immediately open the page you’re looking at right on your PC—or save it to work on later.

<p class="">A few more details about the preview: Initially Microsoft Edge for iOS and Android will launch only in US-English, but we’ll ramp to other countries/languages as we expand the preview. And some features—like roaming passwords and support for iPads/Android tablets—aren’t available at preview launch but will come in the future.</p>

<h1>Microsoft Launcher for Android</h1>

<p class="">Android phones have a feature that iPhones don’t – they allow customization of the “launcher” that’s displayed when you push the phone’s home button. How nice! Today, we are also launching a preview release of our new <strong>Microsoft Launcher</strong> for Android. We think it’s the most beautiful (based on Fluent design), customizable, powerful launcher available. With Microsoft Launcher, your recent photos, documents and more can all Continue on PC as well.</p>
And – just like on Windows 10 – with Microsoft Launcher you can put icons of your favorite people right on the home screen so they’re quickly and easily available.
