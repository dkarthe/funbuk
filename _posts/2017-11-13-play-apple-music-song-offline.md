<span class="mks_dropcap_letter"><span class="dropcap dropcap3">I</span> </span>love Apple Music. It’s one of the finest apps Apple has built. I don’t make songs all songs offline due to the space restrictions on my 16GB iPhone. However, I came to notice that the music app takes the most space on my phone. But how can that be?  I don’t have a tonne of songs in it. Every song that you have streamed once is stored locally. But you can’t play it offline since the music will be greyed out. So, I found a way to get around that. This trick will show you how you can play songs offline without having to make it offline.

<h2><strong>Steps to play any Apple Music offline</strong></h2>
Before beginning, I would like to bring to your attention the fact that this works only if you have streamed the music at least once.

Now follow the steps given below to play any music without internet.
<ol class="list list--ordered">
 	<li class="list__item">Add the song that you need to play to a new playlist.
