One of the main reason as to why iOS users jail break their device is the famous Cydia app. Many people have bought jail broken iPads, iPhones and iPods but have never paid any attention to the Cydia app. When I received my first iPhone, as a gift, I had no clue about Jail Breaking and iPhone unlocking. It has always been my interest to understand things and thus my passion lead me and soon I knew everything about Jail Breaking and Unlocking. I learned about Cydia and Installous. These are the major things that only most qualified Apple professionals know about. Anyways, I am writing this guide because I wish to help all the newbies about how to use Cydia and its features.

Before we begin with this tutorial, I want you all to check whether you Apple / iOS device is jail broken or not? What are the benefits of jail breaking your iPhone? There are many features in iPhone which cannot be used in your standard iPhone. However, Cydia boosts your phones performance and allows you to use lots of features like Multiscreen or Split screen in iPhone. Cydia app allows you to break free from the Apple features prison. In short, you can make use of lots of different features in a jail break iOS device rather than a simple iPhone because App Store doesn’t provide such apps but Cydia tweaks does.

<strong>How to use Cydia for Beginners</strong> : Make sure that your iPhone has Cydia app installed in it. Just search for it in the iPhone search or you can simply look for the Cydia app logo. Simply click the Cydia app icon. Don’t worry if it takes some time because it will do that the first time. You just need to wait and make sure your iPhone is connected to a stable Wi-Fi connection, because that’s a requirement.

Cydia app has been made by very intelligent developers and it must have taken quite a lot of time, money and effort to develop it and thus it is quite justifiable that Cydia is not only providing free tweaks and customization but also paid and premium tweaks for the iPhone users. Personally, I have purchased a few tweaks myself like Ultralinx, My Wi and Screen Display Recorder and not one have been a waste of money. We will chat about Cydia account management some other time, for now let us see the key features of Cydia.

Open your Cydia app and when you have done that it will initiate the rebooting, updates and upgrades of the Cydia sources. The time this process will take to finish solely depends on your Internet connection speed. Once it is loaded you will see some things that I will explain for you below.

<strong>These five options you will see in the footer of the app :</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Homepage of Cydia option.</li>
 	<li>Sections in which you can browse through different sorts of      tweaks.</li>
 	<li>Upgrades and Updates for already installed tweaks will be        available in the Changes.</li>
 	<li>You can add or delete sources in the Manage.</li>
 	<li>Search is the most used option in Cydia app with which you      can find new tweaks.</li>
</ul>
Manage feature will only be required if you are going to spend money for buying a tweak and you will use it for upgrading when that app releases an upgrade. However, in this tutorial we will not be including the manage option.

<strong>How to use Cydia Sections ? </strong>

We will start by explaining every section of the Cydia app to you. By the end of this tutorial you will know How to use Cydia and its other sections.

<strong>Sections :</strong> This is where you will see all the themes and tweaks sorted according to their respective categories. This section makes it easy for the user to find a certain tweak of their choice. You can simply tap ringtone section and choose. Same goes for other tweaks. Tap and download!

<strong>Changes:</strong> This one can be used for to purposes. If you are an old Cydia user and have already installed tweaks then you upgrade it if a latest one is released. Changes tab also shows new tweaks arranged date wise. This helps the Cydia users find tweaks as soon as they are upgraded.

<strong>Manage Section:</strong> You can do many cool things with Cydia. For managing the tweaks and the customization you install in your iPhone using Cydia manage section can be used. It can also be used for uninstallation of tweaks.

<strong>Search:</strong> There is no need for explaining this but for a certain few this section is for finding tweaks. We certainly hope that this Cydia Guide helped you. If you have any question please leave a comment regarding it in comments below.
