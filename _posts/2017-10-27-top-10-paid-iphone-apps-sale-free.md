Ever wished that you could turn your normal day into a rap song?
I’m guessing probably not.
But hey, this is the kind of thing you don’t know that you want in your life until you try it out!

Rapto lets you create music using artificial intelligence &amp; your camera.

Simply point the camera towards any object around you and Rapto will use it’s inbuilt neural network to “understand” the object &amp; create rap music!

*Note – Rapto does not send images to any remote servers to do the image processing. You don’t even need an internet connection actually, so feel free to bring up Rapto next time you want to pass time in an aeroplane!

Sooshi is all about one of the most delicious foods. Whether you are new to the whole topic or you are already a fan of sushi: You will find tons of information about what sushi is, how to prepare sushi and where to find the best sushi places.

Five different categories are offering you a wide variety of information and many topics to discover. Everything was designed and painted from scratch, to achieve highly aesthetic images and views to make the preparation of sushi the biggest possible pleasure for you!

***

SUSHI:

Sooshi provides the most common sushis and an instruction for each traditional type for preparing delicious sushi by yourself. You can interactively browse through the how-tos.
Our app deals with the following traditional sushi types:
• Maki
• Nigiri
• Gunkanmaki

UTENSILS:

For making sushi you will need several utensils. So we added the most important ones to a small list for you, where you can find information about how to deal with each utensil.

FISH:

The most important thing for great sushi is, of course, the fish. Without good fish you won’t have good sushi. That’s the reason why we made a whole section in our app about fish.

INGREDIENTS:

Cooking sushi rice is not easy. But we will help you! Our small cooking tool will assist you in every step for a great result. And of course there are many more ingredients, but don’t panic: We’ll walk you through.

RESTAURANT FINDER:

With the restaurant finder in sooshi you are able to find the nearest sushi-restaurant.
The app takes your current GPS coordinates and uses the Foursquare API to find the best and nearest spot for you to eat some delicious sushi.
