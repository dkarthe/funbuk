<p class="entry-subtitle"><strong>"Google’s second-generation Pixel smartphones are official. Here’s everything you need to know about the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL."</strong></p>
After frequenting rumor rounds over the past few months, the second-generation ‘Made by Google’ smartphones are finally official. Successors to last year’s Pixel and Pixel XL, the new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL come with improved design, under the hood hardware upgrades, latest Android 8.0 Oreo OS and more. The first-gen Pixels were impressive, and as the flagship smartphone landscape has completely changed this year with glass design, edge-to-edge displays and dual-camera setups.<span id="more-518781"></span>

Last month, Apple released three smartphones – the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus with dull and boring looking design similar to iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone 7-series. The third device, the iPhone X, comes with a more futuristic design with edge-to-edge display, FaceID facial recognition and more. Even the likes of Samsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8, Xiaomi Mi MIX 2 and LG V30, to name a few, have impressed with their design and hardware offering. With the competition setting the bar so high, let’s take a look at how Google’s new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL smartphones fare.
<h2>Google Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL design</h2>
Talking about the Pixel 2, the front is dominated with the display, with thick bezels along the top and bottom. You have the front camera module and earpiece, above the display, whereas a slit for speaker grill sits below the display. The earpiece also doubles as a stereo speaker for enhanced multimedia experience.

The back continues to feature a two-tone design, just as the Pixel, with the top half housing the LED flash and the camera module. The bottom half is made from metal and also features a circular fingerprint scanner for biometric authentication. The power / sleep button and volume rocker is placed on the right, whereas the USB Type-C port is at the bottom.

The Pixel 2 XL, on the other hand, comes with a tall display with 18:9 aspect ratio, and thin bezels along the top and bottom. The earpiece and front camera module sit on the top, whereas a slit for speaker grill is at the bottom. Similar to the Pixel 2, the back has a dual tone finish with the fingerprint sensor placed in the lower half. However, the placement of camera module and LED flash has been changed. The buttons and ports placement remains the same.
<h2>Google Pixel 2 specifications</h2>
