We’ve all got smartphones these days, and almost everything we do on them requires using an app.

Wouldn’t it be cool if you could make extra money just for using them? Well, you can.

You’re not going to get rich by downloading mobile apps, but you can use these to earn a little extra money every month.

Considering some of them require you to do nothing, or just watch videos or take some paid surveys, it doesn’t seem like a bad deal to make a few extra bucks.

To get you started, we put together a list of our favorite apps that pay you just for using them…
<h2><b>1. </b><b>This App Pays You to Go On Secret Missions</b></h2>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72689 lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.thepennyhoarder.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/25160002/Screen-Shot-2017-09-21-at-12.44.54-PM.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="799" data-src="https://cdn.thepennyhoarder.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/25160002/Screen-Shot-2017-09-21-at-12.44.54-PM.jpg" />

Remember scavenger hunts when you were a kid? Ever pretend you were a private investigator on an important mission?

Don’t let a few years get in the way of your fun.

<a href="https://www.quickthoughtsapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QuickThoughts</a> turns your cell phone into private-eye technology, taking you on top-secret missions in your area.

Was that CVS you visited last month clean? How do the lines look at that McDonald’s you’ve stopped by for lunch?

QuickThoughts Missions relies on your input — and sneakily-taken cellphone photography — to give businesses important feedback. And like any respectable PI, you get paid for your investigative footwork. Pretending as an adult is looking better and better!

Using your phone’s GPS technology, the app will prompt you for information from places you’ve visited in the past few weeks, as well as places it detects you’re visiting right now.

It even has missions you can accept and complete in the future. For instance, it might prompt you to go to your local Walgreens and snap a photo of the seasonal display.
<h2>2. This App Helps You Sell Your Old Clothes</h2>
<figure id="attachment_47912" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-47912 lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.thepennyhoarder.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/02155300/Guess.jpg" alt="Guess" width="1200" height="800" data-src="https://cdn.thepennyhoarder.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/02155300/Guess.jpg" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption></figure>
Do you still have a prom outfit from, like, 10 years ago?

It’s never going to fit — or come into style — again, but something just keeps holding you back from sending it to Goodwill.

Maybe money could change your mind? Instead of storing clothes indefinitely, try selling them on an app like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.letgo.ar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Letgo.</a>
<h2><b>3. This App Pays You to Take a Picture of Your Receipts</b></h2>
<img src="https://cdn.thepennyhoarder.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/26191301/052417_ibota_TR02282.jpg" alt="Ibotta review" />

Yeah, did you know that you can get paid cash back <strong>just for taking a picture of your receipt</strong>?

Here’s how it works….

1. Sign up for <a href="https://ibotta.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ibotta here</a> (you just need a name/email address to start).

2. Browse through the cash-back offers in your area and take note the next time you go to the store (the offers change every week). For example, in my city, Ibotta will give 2% cash back on Best Buy purchases, $0.25 cash back on any Target purchase, and $3 cash back when I buy an appetizer from any restaurant.  Pretty cool, right?

Once you’ve reached at least $20 in earnings, you can request payment via Paypal or Venmo. <span class="s1"><strong>And right now, Ibotta is giving new users a $10 sign-up bonus, just for redeeming their first receipt</strong>.</span>
<h2>4. <strong><b>This App Pays You to Take Simple Surveys</b></strong></h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://cdn.thepennyhoarder.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/09160442/Ipsos.png" alt="Screenshot of Ipsos Panel" width="495" height="249" />

The <a href="https://thepennyhoarder.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=3003&amp;aff_id=76&amp;aff_sub5=4|rc-b2-3-7088-27411&amp;source=money-making-apps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ipsos I-say mobile app</a> is one of the best, legitimate paid survey apps out there. They’re currently rated an A+ with the Better Business Bureau.

The questions are pretty simple. What do you like more — Coke or Cherry Coke? How many times have you been to the movies in the past 12 months? You get the idea.

You won’t qualify for every panel, but you can usually earn about $5 for 30 minutes of work.
<h2><strong>5. </strong><strong>This App Pays You to Drive Around Town </strong></h2>
<figure id="attachment_60460" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-60460 lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.thepennyhoarder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/13160002/Paul_Pruce02.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" data-src="https://cdn.thepennyhoarder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/13160002/Paul_Pruce02.jpg" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption></figure>

Demand for ridesharing has been growing like crazy, and it shows no signs of slowing down. To be eligible, you’ll need to be at least 21 years old with a year of driving experience, pass a background check and own a car made in 2007 or later.

We <a href="https://www.thepennyhoarder.com/jobs-making-money/lyft-driver-philadelphia/">talked to Paul Pruce</a>, who’s been driving full-time with <a href="https://thepennyhoarder.go2cloud.org/aff_ad?campaign_id=148&amp;aff_id=76&amp;aff_sub5=5|rc-b2-3-7088-27411&amp;source=money-making-apps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Lyft</a> for over a year. He earns $750 a week as a driver.

Best of all, he does it on his own time. You can work days, nights or weekends — it’s up to you!
<h2><b>6. </b><b>This App Pays You to Watch Videos</b></h2>
<figure id="attachment_43652" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-43652 size-large lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.thepennyhoarder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/07180000/WFH_roundup2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Senior woman using mobile apps that pay her for various activities" width="900" height="600" data-src="https://cdn.thepennyhoarder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/07180000/WFH_roundup2-1024x683.jpg" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption></figure>

<h2><b>7. This App Helps You Start Investing — And Pays You $10</b></h2>
<figure id="attachment_71629" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-71629 lazyloaded" src="https://cdn.thepennyhoarder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/07110046/GettyImages-152183169-1024x683.jpg" alt="a close up shot of dollar bills" width="1024" height="683" data-src="https://cdn.thepennyhoarder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/07110046/GettyImages-152183169-1024x683.jpg" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"></figcaption></figure>
We’re kind of obsessed with <a href="https://thepennyhoarder.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2412&amp;aff_id=76&amp;aff_sub5=7|rc-b2-3-7088-27411&amp;source=money-making-apps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Acorns</a> around here (and not just because it gives you $10).

We love that anyone can use Acorns to start investing. You don’t have to have an MBA or even make it all the way through “The Big Short” to understand how to invest with this app.

You just link your bank account and Acorns does the rest by rounding up your purchases to the nearest dollar and investing the change in the stock market.

To get the $10 bonus:

 	<li>Link your bank account, and spend money the way you normally would. Your digital change will get automatically invested.</li>
</ol>
It probably won’t save you enough to retire on, but it’s a terrific reward for <a href="https://thepennyhoarder.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2412&amp;aff_id=76&amp;aff_sub5=7|rc-b2-3-7088-27411&amp;source=money-making-apps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">using a free app,</a> and an easy way to set aside money for the future, without even thinking about it.

Have a bunch of movies or CDs collecting dust on a shelf? <a href="https://thepennyhoarder.go2cloud.org/aff_ad?campaign_id=109&amp;aff_id=76&amp;aff_sub5=8|rc-b2-3-7088-27411&amp;source=money-making-apps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Decluttr</a> will pay you for them!

<h2><strong>9. </strong><b>This App Pays You for Walking Into (and Shopping at) Stores</b></h2>

<h2><strong>10. This App Helps You Find Out Where You Are Wasting Money</strong></h2>

We all sign up for stuff. Sometimes it’s easier to put subscriptions on a recurring payment and forget about it — looking at you Netflix.

Once you sign up and connect your bank account and phone number, it analyzes your transaction history for recurring payments.

When it finds one, the app sends you a text and <a href="https://thepennyhoarder.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=4504&amp;aff_id=76&amp;aff_sub5=10|rc-b2-3-7088-27411&amp;source=money-making-apps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cancels any subscriptions</a> you don’t want to keep.

Deleting your emails could cost you serious money.

Why?

<b>An app called </b><a href="https://thepennyhoarder.go2cloud.org/aff_ad?campaign_id=152&amp;aff_id=76&amp;aff_sub5=11|rc-b2-3-7088-27411&amp;source=money-making-apps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Earny</b></a><b> helps gets you money back for your online purchases at stores like Target, Walmart, Old Navy and more — but you have to keep your email receipts.</b>

<ol start="2">
 	<li>Earny will scan your email archives for receipts. It’ll find your purchases from any of more than 20 partner retailers and monitors the prices everywhere online.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
 	<li><b>Earny tracks to find price drops on your purchase, always trying to get you the most money back. It then claims the difference with the retailer or credit card issuer on your behalf through price protection policies.</b></li>
</ol>
You’ll earn cash back while you lounge at home in your new throwback getup!

There’s something so satisfying about those gas station scratch-off tickets, but it’s better to avoid them because, well, that’s not Penny Hoarding.

Instead, try using a free app like <a href="https://thepennyhoarder.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=5246&amp;aff_id=76&amp;aff_sub5=13|rc-b2-3-7088-27411&amp;source=money-making-apps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Lucktastic</a>.
