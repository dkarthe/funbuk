<h2>ActionPad</h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://is2.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple62/v4/01/56/c4/0156c4a6-20af-c78d-1c75-9de051856791/source/392x696bb.jpg" />

Normally $0.99.

ActionPad is an app that allows you to create your own custom control panels to remote control applications on your computer.

This app requires the ActionPad Server desktop software to be installed on your computer for full functionality. For more information on this, visit <a href="http://actionpad.co/go" rel="nofollow">http://actionpad.co/go</a>. Compatible with Mac and Windows, requires Java 1.8 or later to run.

Panels can contain buttons and other objects, which can be used to simulate keyboard and mouse input, as well as open files and URLs. Drag and resize elements around to organize your panel however you like, and customize objects to give them a distinct look. Get ready to make your keyboard and mouse jealous.

With ActionPad, you may implement buttons on your panel that:
-Execute keystrokes, such as Command C or Ctrl V.
-Move your mouse pointer or hold keys as you hold down the button.
-Launch applications and open files on your computer.
-Open websites in your default browser and interact with them.
-Launch an application, click somewhere on your screen, type into the application, then open an Internet URL when you are done, wait a few seconds, and type into the website (all with one press).

All of this, along with visual elements such as images, text, and containers can all be combined to create individual control panels, each of which with it’s own purpose.

Don’t feel like creating your own panel, or want to use some pre-created panels for some of your favorite desktop apps? ActionPad features the Community Panels Hub, which allows users to upload and share panels they create. It’s very easy to share panels and build upon everyone’s creations. Along with sharing through the Community Panels Hub, you can also export your panel and send it via E-mail, AirDrop, or a variety of other mediums.

Whether it be a panel used to quickly access the most commonly used tools in Photoshop, or a remote control for your PowerPoint presentation, there is no limit to what you can create and control with ActionPad.

Halloween, or Hallowe’en (a contraction of All Hallows’ Evening), also known as Allhalloween, All Hallows’ Eve, or All Saints’ Eve, is a celebration observed in a number of countries on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows’ Day. It begins the three-day observance of Allhallowtide, the time in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all the faithful departed.
