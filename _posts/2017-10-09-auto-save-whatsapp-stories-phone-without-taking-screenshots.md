<p class="entry-subtitle"><strong>You don’t need to take screenshots of other people’s WhatsApp Stories anymore</strong>.</p>
We have been seeing the Stories feature on almost every social media platform now. Facebook has it, Messenger has it, and so does WhatsApp, which basically intended to replace the text status, with a Story status. Now, neither of these platforms allow you to download someone else’s story, for obvious reasons. However, where there is tech, there’s a hack, and there is one to download someone’s story as well.<span id="more-520315"></span>

However, before we actually demonstrate to you how you can download somebody’s story status, we want to urge you to not misuse the hack. You like a quote and you download it, that’s ok, but do not misuse the hack to invade someone’s privacy, by downloading their videos or pictures. It is someone else’s property and does not belong to be in your phone.

If you promise to not misuse it, following is a step-by-step demo of how you can now download a status story, instead of taking a screenshot.

First of all, you must know, every time you view someone’s WhatsApp story, it gets stored locally on your device for 24 hours. You can’t see them in your gallery, but it does remain hidden in your phone’s memory, and they disappear from your WhatsApp cached storage only after 24 hours or if it is pulled down by a user.

Now, since you know that the WhatsApp Stories stays put on your phone, move to your Android device’s file manager. Before you search for the file, head to the setting of the file managing app, and toggle on the option, which reads, ‘Show hidden files’.

Now, go back to the main screen that opened when you launched the file manager app. On the top you will so two tabs, one of which will read ‘Categories’ and the other ‘Local’. Tap on Local &gt; Internal storage. Scroll down to find a folder of WhatsApp and tap on it. Choose ‘Media’ from the folder, and right at the top, you will see a folder called ‘.Statuses’. When you will tap on it, all your viewed WhatsApp stories in the past 24 hours will show up.

In order to save them, long tap on a video, and copy it. Create a new folder locally and paste it to that. Now you can view that status story, any time you want, even when the user pulls it down.
