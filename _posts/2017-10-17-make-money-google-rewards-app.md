One of the best ways to get Android apps for free is to use the Google Opinion Rewards app, a mobile survey tool that rewards you with cash in your Google account every time you complete a few brief questions. With over 5 million installs, this is a popular app, but are you making the best of it? Could you be making more money with Google Opinion Rewards?
<h2>How It Works</h2>
Before we look at how you can tempt Google into giving you more money, we need to take a look at just how Google Opinion Rewards works. Perhaps you’ve never used it, or maybe you’ve used it once and forgot all about it.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-556161" src="http://cdn.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/muo-finance-google-rewards-signup.png?x97327" alt="muo-finance-google-rewards-signup" width="640" height="569" />

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Once installed from the Google Play Store</a> and launched, Google Opinion Rewards requires you to sign into your usual Google account. You should then receive a preliminary “test” survey, partially to make sure you understand your part in this mutually beneficial relationship, and partially to establish your demographic.

Google Opinion Rewards surveys you based on recent shopping experiences. So as long as you have been shopping, you should be able to provide an answer.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-556163" src="http://cdn.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/muo-finance-google-rewards-buy.png?x97327" alt="muo-finance-google-rewards-buy" width="602" height="325" />

Surveys take around 10 seconds to complete, and almost always end up with a few cents being added to your account. Over the course of a few weeks you can end up with enough credit to spend in the Play Store! When you’re ready to buy, go through the usual process, ensuring that your Google Play balance is selected as a payment type, and click <strong>Buy</strong>.

Now that we know how it works, let’s look at how to make more money.
<h2>Enable Location Services</h2>
<p class="linked-out">While you might get questions concerning online purchases, a great deal of the surveys from Google Opinion Rewards relate to your recent journeys. With location services enabled in Android, you get a better chance of receiving surveys that ask you about where you went.</p>
But why the interest?

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-556166" src="http://cdn.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/muo-finance-google-rewards-location2.png?x97327" alt="muo-finance-google-rewards-location2" width="640" height="558" />
<p class="linked-out">Well, in most cases, the information is gathered to help improve Google Maps. You can ensure the correct Location setting is selected by opening <strong>Settings &gt; Location</strong>, enabling the feature, and setting Mode to <strong>High accuracy</strong>.<span class="link-callout visible"><span class="link-callout-image"><span class="link-callout-image-container">Google Maps Feeling Slow?

Here's a Trick to Speed It Up</span><span class="link-callout-excerpt">If Google Maps's latest features are bogging down your computer, here's a simple trick to make it lightning fast again.</span></span></span></p>
This mode uses GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and mobile networks to establish your location, and is the most reliable option. Note that it’s also a privacy minefield, and that it’s likely to reduce your battery life quickly, however. For these reasons, you might wish to avoid this option.
<h2>Keep the App Updated</h2>
As well as having location services enabled, you’ll need to ensure that the app is up-to-date. Changes to the survey collection system may not be compatible with older versions of Google Opinion Rewards, so having the most recent version of the app installed is a major advantage.

To ensure that the app is up-to-date, open the Play Store on your phone, go to the menu and select <strong>Settings.</strong> From here, tap <strong>Auto-update apps</strong> and ensure the setting is enabled; the <strong>Auto-update apps over Wi-Fi only</strong> option is usually the best.
<h2>Open the Google Opinion Rewards App Daily</h2>
Some users reckon that opening the app daily will let Google know that you’re interested, but it is unlikely that this actually works. It’s still a good idea to open the app every day, though.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-556169" src="http://cdn.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/muo-finance-google-rewards-question.png?x97327" alt="muo-finance-google-rewards-question" width="640" height="622" />
<div id="div-swshb-in_content-4-0" class="aligncenter"></div>
While you might be taking surveys by clicking the Google Opinion Rewards app notifications when they appear, opening the app daily will put you into a good habit, and there is some evidence that quick completion of surveys will result in more. If you’re checking regularly, you have a better chance of completing surveys quickly.
<h2>Tell the Truth</h2>
“Cheaters never prosper” seems to be a slightly archaic maxim these days, but in the case of Google Opinion Rewards, it’s accurate. Somehow, they know when your survey answers are inaccurate, and will punish you with a reduced rate of surveys. This is done by providing you with “fake” surveys; if a you receive such a survey, be honest.

Trick questions might involve asking you if you went to a particular location that you didn’t visit, or engaged in a particular activity (perhaps skydiving). They’re easily spotted, but you’ll receive fewer fake surveys if you answer truthfully. If you lie, say goodbye to Google Opinion Rewards for a while.
<h2>Be an Affluent Female</h2>
It seems that high-spending, regularly shopping women get more opportunities for generating rewards with the Google Reward Opinions.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-556170" src="http://cdn.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/muo-finance-google-rewards-credit.png?x97327" alt="muo-finance-google-rewards-credit" width="640" height="387" />

If you’re not an affluent female, you can ensure that you’re presented with more surveys by copying some simple behaviors. Regular shopping trips to well-known stores is the best way to do this. Sitting around at home is not the way to generate surveys from Google!
<h2>Be Ready at Christmas</h2>
It shouldn’t really come as a surprise, but it’s worth mentioning: you’ll make more from Google Opinion Rewards in the final quarter of the year (September–December) as this is when people are typically shopping online for the Christmas period.

Companies that contract Google to survey their users want to know about your shopping habits, so it makes sense that they’ll be trying to pull in this information — thanks to Google’s “instant gratification” surveys — in the period when you do the most shopping.

So, if you want to generate credits for the Play Store with Google Opinion Rewards, make sure you have it installed, updated, and regularly checked in the run-up to Christmas.
<h2>Don’t Let Your Rewards Run Out!</h2>
It’s a nice feeling to see the balance in your Play Store account rising. Each time you complete a survey, your updated balance will be displayed, as you save up for a new app or game.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-556172" src="http://cdn.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/muo-finance-google-rewards-earnings.png?x97327" alt="muo-finance-google-rewards-earnings" width="640" height="569" />

Google Opinion Rewards credit expires after 12 months, so you need to keep using the app and spending the credits. If you don’t, you’ll have wasted your time and effort.

A good way to stop this happening is to keep a list of apps and games that you want to buy. You can do this by marking them for later, by clicking the <strong>Add to wishlist</strong> button. Wishlist items can be viewed by clicking <strong>My wishlist</strong> in Google Play.
