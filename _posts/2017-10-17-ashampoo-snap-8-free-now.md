<strong>OCR-based text recognition</strong>
The newly added text recognition turns text inside screenshots into editable computer text in a few mouse clicks. This way, users can convert faxed, scanned or photographed documents into real text. Several world languages are supported: English, Spanish, French, German, Turkish and Russian.

<strong>Completely overhauled video mode</strong>
The immense success of how-to and tutorial videos on video networks like Youtube inspired our developers to enhance and extend this area of Ashampoo Snap 8. Users can now create webcam recordings, add voice narration and even include webcam output in their screen recordings as picture-in-picture. An ideal solution for staff training and work instructions.

<strong>Improved image editing and processing</strong>
More than 50 effects provide ample opportunity for users to edit and process screenshots using arrows, shapes and text to direct attention. To create causality chains, users can now share objects between screenshots or import existing images. Ashampoo Snap 8 offers endless possibilities to visualize thoughts through images.

<strong>Ashampoo Webspace upload</strong>
For instant sharing and communication, screenshots and videos can be uploaded to Ashampoo Webspace and shared with friends, colleagues and family through unique Internet links. Uploading to popular cloud space providers such as Dropbox, Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive is also supported.
<strong>
Ashampoo Snap for business</strong>
