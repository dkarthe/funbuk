<strong>Learn how to safely update your outdated drivers fast and easily!</strong>
<div class="entry-content">

A driver software is a program that controls the hardware devices such as network adapters, Graphics card, etc. These driver softwares are critical for your PC to function properly and that’s why manufacturers include them with the product usually in an optical disc. Since this driver software is responsible for controlling the hardware their efficiency matters a lot. Update to these device drivers is the fastest way for device manufacturer’s to bring out new features to the device and to improve its efficiency.

It is very important to keep your device drivers up to date as they can bring out new features, improve performance, fix bugs, etc. without modifications to the hardware. What’s more interesting is that all device drivers are free so why not update to the latest!

Because these drivers are so important for the devices, you should always be cautious to download them from trustworthy sources. In this article, we are sharing 3 trusty methods to install device drivers.

<h2>3 Safe Ways to Update Device Drivers</h2>
<h4>1. Download from manufacturer’s site</h4>

Not only does it help in keeping away from malware but it also shows you the changes from the previous version thereby helping you make a better decision of whether to download them or not. I have included the driver download pages for some of the manufacturers below.

<h4>2.Device Manager</h4>

You can easily <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update to the latest device drivers using the windows device manager</a>. To open device manager, right click on the windows logo (bottom left) and click on device manager.
Now expand one of the categories to find the name of your device. Right click on it and select <strong>Update Driver, </strong>then choose <strong>Search Automatically for updated driver </strong>option and wait for it to finish.

This method is completely safe to follow but it requires you to manually update each driver. Furthermore, you’ll never know what new features or bug fixes have been implemented in it. If you want to see the driver software change log, then you should manually download it from the manufacturer’s website.
<h4>1.Driver Booster</h4>
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/codegena.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/driver-booster-free.png?resize=770%2C513&amp;ssl=1" alt="Iobit Driver Booster - Update Device Drivers Fast " />

Iobit’s Driver Booster is a software that automatically downloads the latest device drivers and keeps your system up-to-date. There are a lot of device driver updater software but I can confidently say that Iobits makes the best! Their in-app experience is totally cool!
