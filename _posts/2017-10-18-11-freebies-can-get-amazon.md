Every time a box from Amazon shows up on the front porch, I get excited.

For many people, especially those of us who live in rural communities, Amazon offers an easy way to get what we need, from clothing to electronics to groceries.

And no matter where you live, it’s pretty cool to be able to simply order what you need and have it arrive on your doorstep a few days later.

But no matter how awesome it is to save money shopping on Amazon, getting stuff for free is even better.
<h2><b>How to Get Free Stuff From Amazon</b></h2>
Who doesn’t love free stuff? Here are 11 freebies you can get from the online retailer.
<h3><b>1. Free Albums</b></h3>
If you love music, check out the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;bbn=163856011&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;pf_rd_i=678551011&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_p=1745000742&amp;pf_rd_r=18E277VE91Z3PB5SFWER&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-left-2&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;rh=i%3Adigital-music-album%2Cn%3A163856011%2Cp_n_feature_browse-bin%3A625150011%2Cp_36%3A2237412011&amp;tag=thepenhoa-20&amp;linkId=32VXAJEA7KTAPKOW" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free album listings on Amazon</a>. Simply sort the list by price, making sure to select the “low to high” ranking feature, and you’ll see all the free options first.

You’ll see music from all genres, so you can find something to enjoy no matter your taste, from Christmas collections to metal albums.
<h3><b>2. Free MP3 Singles</b></h3>
Enjoy a huge library of <a href="http://amzn.to/1KS56r4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free, downloadable MP3 singles</a>. When we checked, there was everything from Blondie to She &amp; Him to the Tbilisi Symphony Orchestra.

If you subscribe to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/prime.html/?ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1433519050596&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=pf4&amp;tag=thepenhoa-20&amp;linkId=EPT6TVROC4BC7DT7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Prime</a>, you’ll find even more songs you can download for free!
<h3><b>3. Free or Low-Cost Music From New Artists</b></h3>
If you’re at the cutting edge of the music scene (or want to be), check out the deals offered under “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=n%3A163856011%2Cn%3A%212334092011%2Cn%3A%212334154011%2Cn%3A7933257011%2Cp_n_music_subscription%3A14392236011%2Cp_n_feature_browse-bin%3A625150011&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1500652305" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artists to Watch</a>.”

Amazon editors select a number of albums they think are likely to be big this year. Current selections include Royal Blood, ODESZA, The 1975, KONGOS and more.

If you’re an Amazon Prime member (or enjoying a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/tryprimefree/?ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1427739975520&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=pf4&amp;tag=thepenhoa-20&amp;linkId=BB5WQTZZMWS7TJB2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30-day free trial</a>), you can score these albums for free. Otherwise, you can get them at a special discount from their regular price.
<h3><b>4. Free Movies and TV Shows</b></h3>
Once you pay for your Amazon Prime membership (or snag a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/tryprimefree/?ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1427739975520&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=pf4&amp;tag=thepenhoa-20&amp;linkId=BB5WQTZZMWS7TJB2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30-day free trial</a>), you can watch more than 40,000 free movies and TV shows via <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/video/primesignup/?ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1428642208880&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=pf4&amp;tag=thepenhoa-20&amp;linkId=PS64DSFZADAWICWD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Instant Video</a>.
<h3><b>5. Free Kindle Ebooks</b></h3>
Grab something new to read or take a chance on a new author.

Every day, new freebies pop up in the listings. Some are permanently free ebooks, which the author offers in hopes that you’ll buy the next book in the series, while others are limited-time deals.

Check out the <a href="http://amzn.to/1cCxM8D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top 100 free ebooks</a> or sort ebooks in any category from “low” to “high” prices to see what’s available. You’ll see tons of options, from books of vegetarian slow cooker recipes to romance novels to career planning books to mysteries.
<h3><b>6. Free Kindle Lending Library</b></h3>
Another perk of Amazon Prime membership (or again, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/tryprimefree/?ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1427739975520&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=pf4&amp;tag=thepenhoa-20&amp;linkId=BB5WQTZZMWS7TJB2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free trial</a>) is that you can borrow one new book each month out of the 800,000 in the <a href="http://amzn.to/1RQBBa6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kindle Owners’ Lending Library</a>.

And it’s not just a collection of unpopular books that don’t sell. The library includes more than 100 bestsellers; for example, it has the full collection of Harry Potter books.
<h3><b>7. Borrow a Book from a Friend</b></h3>
Just as you can borrow or lend a paperback book to a friend, you can also <a href="http://amzn.to/1KS8pOW" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lend an ebook</a>.

This little-known service allows you to share a Kindle ebook purchased from Amazon with a friend for 14 days. The borrower doesn’t even need to have a Kindle; they just need to download a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/associates/AppDownload/?ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1402131685749&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=pf4&amp;program=1&amp;tag=thepenhoa-20&amp;linkId=ZVXGYF7YTMH6L2GQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free Kindle reading app</a>.

To loan your book, go to the product page from your Amazon purchase and select the “loan” option. Once it’s loaned to a friend, just like a regular book, you’ll be unable to read it until it’s returned. You can only loan each book once, so think about who you’d most like to share it with!
<h3><b>8. Free Shipping</b></h3>
When you order physical products, you generally want to receive them cheaply and quickly as possible.

If you’re an Amazon Prime member, you’ll get free two-day shipping on every order. Even if you’re not a Prime member, just bundle your orders so they add up to more than $35, and Amazon will give you free regular shipping.
<h3><b>9. Free Stuff With Points</b></h3>
You can redeem <a href="http://amzn.to/1RQCRtI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">credit card points </a>from a number of different cards (including Amazon.com Rewards Visa Card, Citi ThankYou Rewards, American Express Membership Rewards, Cashback Bonus from Discover and Chase Ultimate Rewards) right on Amazon.

Simply select “points” as a payment method when you check out. You don’t need enough points to pay for your full order; if you only want to use points to cover a portion, you can specify that option.

Keep in mind that points cannot be used for all products on Amazon. Kindle downloads, AmazonFresh, Subscribe and Save and pre-orders are all exempt. But if you do a lot of shopping on Amazon, you might prefer to earn credit card rewards you can redeem there!
<h3><b>10. Amazon Student Benefits</b></h3>
In college? Sign up for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/student/signup/info/?ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1402130811706&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=pf4&amp;tag=thepenhoa-20&amp;linkId=R76QAONQIJRN5BQB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Student </a>to enjoy great benefits only available to students. You can try the program for six months for free, and then it becomes a half-price Amazon Prime membership.

You’ll get free two-day shipping, photo storage, streaming TV, movies, music, and other benefits (though not all benefits apply during the six-month trial period — music, movie and TV benefits are excluded).

Another cool benefit? You’ll get $10 for every other student who signs up using your link!
<h3><b>11. Free Photo Storage</b></h3>
Enjoy a three-month free trial of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/unlimited/ref=CD_CC_SO_PL/179-9574200-2635064?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=special-offers-3&amp;pf_rd_r=1R6FHNZMS57BRZ1KGQHF&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_p=2063007862&amp;pf_rd_i=B00A11AN6O" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Cloud Drive’s</a> unlimited storage plans for your photos, videos and files. You can also share photos a number of different ways, including Facebook, email and other options.

If you’re a Prime member, you’ll get unlimited free photo storage as well as 5GB of storage for videos and other files.
