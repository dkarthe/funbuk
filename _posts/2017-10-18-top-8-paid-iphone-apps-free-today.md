<em>This post covers paid iPhone and iPad apps that have been made available for free for a limited time by their developers.</em><em>There is no way to tell how long they will be free. These sales could end an hour from now or a week from now — obviously, the only thing we can guarantee is that they were free at the time this post was written. If you click on a link and see a price listed next to an app instead of the word “get,” it is no longer free. The sale has ended. If you download the app anyway, you will be charged by Apple.</em>

You need inspiration for your next design and a place to store all the colors you use for a project? Or you simply want to find out which color code corresponds to apple green or fire engine red?

Coloresque is a handy essential for everyone who works with colors. It’s a simple yet powerful tool for color inspiration, creation, identification and modification.

PLAYGROUND
******************************
Start by generating a completely random color to help inspire your next design creation. Just with a single tap, Coloresque can show and name any one of over 16 million possible colors.

Additional tools allow you to modify your selected color. Drag down the main view to reveal a variety of automatically generated, associated color schemes, or use sliders to precisely adjust it.

• Generate a broad range of colors
• Each color is identified and named
• Create numerous colour schemes (shades, tints, tones, analogous, monochromatic, triad, tetrad, complementary, split complementary, inverted &amp; components)
• RGB and HSL sliders
• Go back to the previously selected colour

FAVORITES
******************************
Once you find a color you like, you can save it as a favorite in a beautiful overview of all your preferred colors, which you can filter by hue. Coloresque will identify which colors you view most often and emphasize them by increasing the cell size.

• Save the colors you like
• Identify your most viewed colors
• Colors are automatically sorted into lists of hues
• Share color codes and preview images
• Copy&amp;Paste color codes

ADD FAVORITES
******************************
By providing multiple methods, Coloresque makes it super easy to add colors to your favorites. You can grab a color from an imported image, search colors by name or enter a color code in any supported format and it will be interpreted correctly.

• Grab a color from a photo or screenshot
• Search and view colors by their names or codes
• Big color database with different color packages and standards (CSS, Crayola, RAL, Resene, Pantone, ISCC-NBS, X11, AS 2700, XKCD &amp; London Underground)
• Precise conversion between all supported color spaces
• Search for color codes
• Smart color format detection

COLOR PICKER
******************************
Simply select a photo or screenshot from your camera roll. A hair cross points at the pixel of which the color will be grabbed. For higher precision, a magnified aspect of the image is shown on top of the screen.

• Import photos, snapshots and screenshots from your camera roll
• Easily pick a color from any image
• Magnifier for precise color selection
• Pan, pinch &amp; zoom to select a color from a pixel

PREFERENCES
******************************
The Preferences page enables you to customize Coloresque to your needs. You can set your preferred color format which will be used throughout the app, exclude certain hues from being generated or hide and rearrange color schemes.

• Supports all common color formats (Hex, RGB, HSL, HSV, CMYK, CIE XYZ &amp; CIE L*a*b)
• Disable/enable and rearrange hues and color schemes
• Reset preferences and favorites

DARK THEME
******************************
The whole user interface adapts to the currently selected color in Playground to provide a preview of the color being used in a real life scenario. This includes the ability to decide if it should be combined with dark or light colors to retain the visibility and readability of interface elements.

Pic Navi is an easy-to-use photo location viewer and editor. Browse pictures normally, and when you find a photo that you want to know where you took it, you can open a map that gives you driving, walking, cycling and transportation direction from your current location. You can adjust the photo location just by dragging a pin on a map. When you have a photo without GPS information, you can add it by typing an address. You can also remove GPS information when you want to make sure your privacy is protected.

Pic Navi can edit date and time of the photo. When you save photos you get from someone else, they are saved with the date and time they are saved, not when they were actually taken. You can modify it with Pic Navi, so for example, your photos and the photos you get from your friends can stick together. With Timezone Support, Pic Navi shows you the local time of the photo location, instead of your current timezone. Travel pictures with the accurate timestamp make revive your memory more vividly.

Use Pic Navi when you want to share a photo with its timestamp, like an old school camera. You can customize its size, format, font and color to your liking. You can also hide the timestamp by setting the font size to zero.

Features
– Direction from your current location to the location of the photo using a map app of your choice.
– Add, edit or remove location
– Customizable timestamp.
– Edit date and time.
– Timezone Support
– Albums in alphabetical order, plus search function
– Share one or more pictures with timestamps inscribed.
