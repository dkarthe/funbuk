<p class="entry-subtitle"><strong>Microsoft has also launched Ruuh, an AI bot, and Diwali-themed emoticons for all Skype products.</strong></p>
Microsoft launched a lighter version of its video calling platform, Skype, in India earlier this February. Skype Lite was introduced for low-end Android smartphone running on slow internet connectivity. Microsoft has now introduced new features for Skype Lite users in India in tune with Diwali celebrations.

To start with, Microsoft has made group video calls available for all users. You can now video chat in groups free of cost. Skype has an initial trial period for group video calls after which it starts charging users. You can also share links for your group video calls on social messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Microsoft also allows you to invite friends who don’t have a Skype Lite account. These people can simply click on the video call link, and join the conversation as a guest. This guest account will be valid for 24 hours for each user. Even for those who have trouble logging in to their Skype accounts can join in as guest, since signing in isn’t required.

Microsoft has also launched its desi AI bot Ruuh, and new Diwali-themed emoticons for all its Skype products. You can chat with Ruuh on Skype Lite, and also make Diwali cards with the AI bot. Ruuh converses in English, and is available only for users in India. As Microsoft points out, Ruuh is capable of sending and receiving instant messages, and photos. In terms of access, Ruuh will have knowledge of your Skype name, chat messages and content of your contacts.

Microsoft’s efforts for making Skype Lite India-centric is quite noticeable with the most recent being Aadhaar integration. Skype Lite allows users in India to add their Aadhaar details on the app for verification. You can also choose whether you want to share your Aadhaar details with other contacts or not. If integrated, your Aadhaar details will be visible to the other parties.
