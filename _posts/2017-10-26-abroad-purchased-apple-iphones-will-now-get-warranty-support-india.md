<p class="h2h"><em><strong>Apple India will now honour the warranty for iPhones purchased abroad. Only the factory unlocked versions of the iPhones will be eligible to get warranty benefits.</strong></em></p>

<div>According to a report by <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/apple_india_now_provides_international_warranty_on_iphones-news-27920.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">GSMArena</a>, Apple India will now honour warranties for iPhones which users have purchased abroad.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Apple only supported international warranties for products such as the MacBook, iPad, and iPod. Now, even if consumers buy an unlocked iPhone from countries like the US, their one-year warranty claim on the device will be applicable in India. The report states that the warranty claim only applies to the factory unlocked versions of the iPhone.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The carrier-locked models do not get the local warranty benefits, even if the buyer successfully unlocks them. Previously, if one bought the iPhone from outside India, they weren’t eligible for the one year warranty on the smartphone and had to pay for repairs themselves.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If the reports are true, Apple has made this move when its flagship device, the iPhone X is nearing launch. The Iphone X will be launched in India priced at Rs 89,000 for the 64GB model and at Rs 1.2 lakhs for the 256GB variant. If you are considering buying the smartphone, it is worth noting that the iPhone X is priced starting at $999 (Rs 65,000 approx directly converted) in the US for the 64GB variant.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Apple’s iPhone X is powered by an A11 Bionic processor which features a neural engine required for utilising AR, Face ID and more. The company claims that its Face ID feature gets better each time as it scans a user’s face for unlocking the iPhone. Apple is reportedly facing some issues in the production of the iPhone due to the face recognition feature. A report had claimed that the company has told its manufacturers to lower the accuracy of the new facial recognition system on the iPhone X in order to boost productions. Apple issued a statementsaying that the claims are completely false and they expect Face ID to be the new “gold standard” for facial authentication. You can read more about it here.</div>
