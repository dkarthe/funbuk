<em>This post covers paid iPhone and iPad apps that have been made available for free for a limited time by their developers. There is no way to tell how long they will be free. These sales could end an hour from now or a week from now — obviously, the only thing we can guarantee is that they were free at the time this post was written. If you click on a link and see a price listed next to an app instead of the word “get,” it is no longer free. The sale has ended. If you download the app anyway, you will be charged by Apple.</em>

<h2>ENZO: Simple Haptic Keyboard</h2>

Utilizing Apple’s Taptic Engine (iPhone 7 and above), every touch gives you a satisfying click. The soft vibration makes you feel like you are typing on a real keyboard. All this is packaged in an interface that is both familiar and intuitive. Every button is deliberately placed to create an experience that you can enjoy.

Download ENZO and start typing!

We spend almost a third of our waking hours on our phones. The majority of this time is spent typing on keyboards that give us no satisfaction. We believe that an activity that we spend so much time on should be enjoyed. With ENZO, we hope to do just that.

Third party mobile keyboards today are too complicated. They give us too many customizing options that we don’t even know where to start. They provide us with too many buttons that we will never use. We want to empower you by giving you a keyboard you don’t have to second guess. Every key you press is exactly what is typed on the screen.

You can use this when you’re texting friends, composing emails, or writing notes. The possibilities are endless.

Getting started is easy. Simply download and open the app and follow the onscreen instructions to install. Once you’ve enabled full access (required for haptic feedback), you’ll be good to go!

Enjoy typing again with ENZO!
