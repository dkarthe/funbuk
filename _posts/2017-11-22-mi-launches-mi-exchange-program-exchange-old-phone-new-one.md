<h2>A New Exchange Program:</h2>
NEW DELHI: Chinese smartphone maker <strong>Xiaomi</strong> has partnered with Cashify in order to launch a new Exchange Program. Under the exchange program, users will be able to exchange their old smartphone for a new Xiaomi device by going to their nearest Mi Home.

Presently, the company has 11 Mi Home stores in country across Delhi/NCR, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Mumbai and Chennai.

At the time of exchanging the old phone, the Cashify team will suggest the resale value of the device depending on its condition and resale value. Users can then use the same amount to get a discount for a new Xiaomi device at the store. Users are only allowed to exchange only one device for a Xiaomi phone.

Customers can also get a pickup service for the old phone they wish to exchange. In case, a customer purchases a new smartphone from the Mi Store and makes the complete payment then you can call and arrange for a pickup with Cashify. Once everything is fixed, the Cashify executive will come to collect the phone and will give the decided amount to the customer.
