Don’t Die, Mr. Robot! is an arcade bullet hell fruit ’em up.

Deep in the electro-abyss lives a little robot who loves to eat exploding fruit. He also quite likes staying alive. That’s where you come in…

The hook to the game is the scoring system – each exploding fruit sets off adjacent fruits creating crazy-satisfying chains. As well as looking and sounding awesome, each explosion adds a multiplier to points scored with the chain.

You’ll reach nail-biting levels of tension waiting until your fruit amasses on screen before you set one off triggering a massive chain explosion for maximum scoring!

GAME MODES:

Remix Mode: Battle through 50 unique missions in Remix Mode which mess up the rules and push you to the limits of your reactions and skill.

Arcade Mode: A never ending, different every time arena based fun machine! Hit the global leader boards and try and become the world’s best dodger.

Time Attack: 2m30 at tweaked difficulty to hone your skills. Dying costs time and points, so don’t die!

Chill Out Mode: A more sedate and strategic but equally intense mode for when your nerves are just too fried to take on the game at full pace.

BONUS:

Unlock special guest characters from other Indie Games!

Gurn along to the legendary soundtrack

Customise your Robot with costumes and hats.

Super smooth and configurable gyro controls.

Besides having 36 amazingly versatile, high-quality filters and a buttery-smooth interface, Fotograf does a bunch of useful things your other photo apps don’t, including:

– Allows you to make your own presets by tweaking built-in filters or saving a set of adjustments as your own custom filter.
– If there are, say, 3 filters that you use all the time, save them each as their own custom presets (without any additional adjustments) and they’ll show up at the very front of your list of filters for easy access at all times.
– Has the perfect no-fuss manual camera mode, with a single exposure slider, to let you get perfectly-exposed shots without having to mess with a bunch of other settings.
– The app automatically opens to either the in-app camera or your photo library, depending on which you last used, to get you quickly to the part where you’re choosing or taking photos.
– Features a brilliantly simple way to take well-exposed flash photos: when you enable the flash, it turns it on and leaves it on until you take the photo, so you can see the effect the flash will have (and adjust exposure if you want) before taking the shot.
– Works in portrait or landscape mode – so if you want to take photos in the app and edit them, you can do so without having to keep changing your phone orientation back and forth.
– You can take photos and have them auto-saved in any filter – just long-press on a filter to enter the in-app camera in auto-filter mode for that filter, and every photo you take will then be automatically filtered and saved to your library.
– There’s no silly and annoying extra step of having to import photos into a separate in-app library – just load and save things directly to and from your camera’s existing photo library.
– The filters are grouped into collapsible sets, so you can hide whole sets of filters you don’t want to worry about.
– Everything in Fotograf is tuned for photo fidelity – from the way the in-app camera takes photos to the bit depth of the adjustments (96-bit), Fotograf’s entire pipeline is engineered for incredibly high fidelity.
– Use our desktop app, CameraBag Photo, to fully craft your own filters using a huge array of adjustment tools, and import them for use in Fotograf.

This is probably the funniest app on App Store! Let ‘Em Decide is a decision making app in the form of popular clips from popular shows and movies!

Struggling with a decision? And looking for a lot more fun way than flipping a coin? Then Let’Em Decide it! This is an app that answers your questions! Let us pick a truly random answer for you, just press the button.
Let’Em Decide is for quick decision making with your iPhone or iPad.
