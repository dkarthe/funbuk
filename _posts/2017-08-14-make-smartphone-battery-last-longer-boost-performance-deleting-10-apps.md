<h6>IF YOU are sick and tired of your smartphone running out of battery, it might be time to delete these 10 apps from your phone.</h6>
DOES your smartphone keep running out of battery too quickly?

If so, you’ll need to find out about which apps use the most energy — and then get them deleted, reports <i>The Sun</i>.

The tech firm Avast has revealed the 10 apps which will “sap the life out of your Android phone”.

It analysed data from 3000,000 Android users to discover which apps had the largest impact on battery life, storage capacity and mobile data usage.

Gagan Singh, a mobile business expert at Avast, said: “For many of us, our smartphones are the main device in our everyday lives.

“Knowing which of our favourite apps are the hardest-hitting on battery life, data usage, and storage is important so we can manage any that we are regularly using on our phones.

“Industry stats show smartphone sales grew 9.1 per cent in the first quarter of this year and Android devices continue to dominate market share.

“Affordable smartphones, however, can compromise on features like device storage so the experience of the user is increasingly important and how apps affect a phone’s performance is critical.”

The analysis found Google’s own apps were particularly greedy, with its Play Music, Talkback and Docs apps appearing in the run down.

The offenders were split into two categories.

In the list of apps which load when the phone starts up, Samsung’s AllShare app was the worst. It lets you share content across your devices but uses up a lot of energy in the process.

Samsung’s WatchOn, which lets people use their device to watch films or telly shows on their televisions, was the worst offender in a list of the apps, which need to be manually opened up.

This app has now been discontinued.

Apps from Snapchat, Facebook and Spotify have all disappeared off this list, having previously occupied three of the four top spots for performance-draining apps.
