If you’re an Apple fan, you’re probably doing everything you can to save your money for the iPhone X, which becomes available for pre-order next Friday. We’ll do our part by saving you as much cash as possible on apps. We’ve got nine premium iPhone and iPad apps for you to check out on Wednesday, and they’re all on sale for a limited time. Definitely check them out before these sales end.

<em>This post covers paid iPhone and iPad apps that have been made available for free for a limited time by their developers. </em><em>here is no way to tell how long they will be free. These sales could end an hour from now or a week from now — obviously, the only thing we can guarantee is that they were free at the time this post was written. If you click on a link and see a price listed next to an app instead of the word “get,” it is no longer free. The sale has ended. If you download the app anyway, you will be charged by Apple.</em>
<h2>WiFi Pal</h2>

<h2>Haptic Keyboard: ENZO</h2>
<img class="aligncenter" src="http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/6f/ac/43/6fac43b5-e990-d22b-a135-fb4a4e6de131/source/392x696bb.jpg" />

Normally $0.99.

Utilizing Apple’s Taptic Engine (iPhone 7 and above), every touch gives you a satisfying click. The soft vibration makes you feel like you are typing on a real keyboard. All this is packaged in an interface that is both familiar and intuitive. Every button is deliberately placed to create an experience that you can enjoy.

Download ENZO and start typing!

We spend almost a third of our waking hours on our phones. The majority of this time is spent typing on keyboards that give us no satisfaction. We believe that an activity that we spend so much time on should be enjoyed. With ENZO, we hope to do just that.

Third party mobile keyboards today are too complicated. They give us too many customizing options that we don’t even know where to start. They provide us with too many buttons that we will never use. We want to empower you by giving you a keyboard you don’t have to second guess. Every key you press is exactly what is typed on the screen.

You can use this when you’re texting friends, composing emails, or writing notes. The possibilities are endless.

Getting started is easy. Simply download and open the app and follow the onscreen instructions to install. Once you’ve enabled full access (required for haptic feedback), you’ll be good to go!

At ENZO, we believe that your keyboard isn’t the only thing that you should give you satisfaction. In fact, every moment of your life should give you satisfaction. Therefore, we have additionally added a feature that allows you to be present every day of your life.

To find out what it is, download today!

<img class="aligncenter" src="http://is1.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple122/v4/21/40/f6/2140f604-e6ff-14b5-970d-67808f441516/source/392x696bb.jpg" />

Normally $0.99.

Okappy is a simple to use Job Management application, helping you see where your engineers are, send and receive jobs and then monitor the status of your jobs in real time as they’re updated by your engineers out in the field.

This means no more paper job sheets and their associated costs, it means you and your customers know what’s going on as it happens and you can raise your invoices as soon as the job is complete, without having to wait for your engineers or subcontractors to bring their job sheets back at the end of the week (or month).

With Okappy you can connect to your customers and subcontractors. Your customers can create jobs and send them to you and, unlike other job management solutions, you can allocate jobs not just to your own engineers but also to your subcontractors.

Okappy takes away the hassle of paper based job sheets, putting job information directly into the hands of your engineers or subcontractors.

You can monitor your colleagues’ location and time when they arrive and leave a site as well as send and receive messages from your desktop, iPad or iPhone.

Ultimately, you can reduce costs, increase revenues and make you, your customers and your employees Okappy!

Please note that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

With Okappy’s iPhone and iPad Monitor app, you can view jobs allocated to you, see the location of your colleagues and send and receive instant messages. You can also add jobs from the application with 10 jobs included free. Once you run out of jobs you can purchase additional job bundles through the app.

You can also connect to your web account where additional features are available such as reporting, invoicing and much more. Additional subscriptions apply.
