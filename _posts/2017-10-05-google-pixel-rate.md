As expected, Google today took the wraps off its next-generation Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. Prices for the smartphones in India start from Rs 61,000, and go up to Rs 82,000. <span id="more-518844"></span>
<h2>Google Pixel 2 India pricing and availability</h2>
The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL smartphones have been launched in two variants each. The Pixel 2 64GB variant is priced at Rs 61,000, while the 128GB variant is priced at Rs 70,000. The Pixel 2 XL 64GB variant is priced at Rs 73,000, and the 128GB variant is priced at Rs 82,000. The flagship smartphones will go on sale in India from November 15, and pre-orders are set to kick off from October 26. Buyers will be able to choose from color options including Just Black, Kinda Blue, Clearly White and Black &amp; White. The devices will be available exclusively on Flipkart.
<h2>Google Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL specifications and features</h2>
As far as specifications are concerned, the Pixel 2 features a 5-inch full HD OLED display, Snapdragon 835 octa-core SoC, and 4GB of RAM. There are two storage options on offer – 64GB and 128GB. For photography, there is a 12.2-megapixel rear camera, coupled with an 8-megapixel front camera. The rest of the features include all-day battery life, water and dust resistant capabilities, and connectivity options like 4G with VoLTE, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS and Wi-Fi 802.11ac.

The Pixel 2 XL shares a similar set of specifications and features, albeit with a few differences. For one, it flaunts a 6-inch P-OLED QHD+ display with an 18:9 aspect ratio. It also boasts a slightly larger battery. Both the smartphones come with built-in Google Assistant, and HTC U11-like squeezable frame to invoke the virtual assistant. On the software front, it runs on Android Oreo out-of-the-box.
