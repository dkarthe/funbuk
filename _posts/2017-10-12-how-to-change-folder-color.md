<h2><strong>Folder Colorizer</strong></h2>
It is a small Windows application created to assign a different color to any folder on your system.Basic technical knowledge is enough because Folder Colorizer introduces an entry in the Context Menu and thus allows you to simply right click a folder to change its color.The application already comes with eight predefined colors, but it also allows you to define your very own and even save it by writing down an unique name.Itâ€™s all just a matter of clicks and while this could be very well considered just a task more appropriate for rookies, it could come in handy to every computer user out there,The application doesnâ€™t affect system performance in any way and the best of all is that it works smoothly on all Windows versions on the market. Whatâ€™s more, it only asks for administrator privileges in order to change the color of system-protected folders.Last but not least, you donâ€™t even need to let the app running in order to keep the new folder colors, so computer performance isnâ€™t affected at all.All things considered, Folder Colorizer is an app that could help plenty of users out there, offering one of the most user-friendly approaches on the market. Shell integration clearly helps a lot and since itâ€™s all so intuitive, the lack of a help manual shouldnâ€™t bother you too much.
