<p>I am Karthik, a graduate in Electronics and communication engineering from Sri Ganesh College of Engineering & Technology, one of the prestigious academic institutions under Pondicherry University, Pondicherry (UT), India. My fascination towards Electronics and its related areas from childhood had intrigued me to opt for Electronic and communication as my undergraduate course. I did My Intermediate at St.Joseph's Hr.Sec School. 
After my graduation, I was attended in an Bharat Electronics Ltd as a Graduate Apprenticeship Engineer, where I started working more on wired/wireless communication. I was responsible for effective provisioning, installation, configuration, operation, maintenance of systems hardware & software and related infrastructure, participating in technical research and development to enable continuous innovations within the infrastructure. I learned more about networking and my passion for knowing more grew with it.
I am experienced in Managing and troubleshooting routers and switches. Router Link related issues and maintenance and commissioning wired lines and connectivity issues, if the problem exists; ensure quality delivery and support of the network infrastructure.</p>
